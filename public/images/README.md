Drop your statue PNGs here with these filenames so the UI picks them up automatically:

- odin-statue.png
- odysseus-statue.png
- zeus-statue.png

Recommendations:
- Use PNG with transparent background.
- Recommended size (2x): 480 × 896 px (portrait). Keep aspect ≈ 3:5.
- Keep file size < 500 KB if possible; consider WebP for production.

After dropping the files in this folder run:

```powershell
git add public\images\odin-statue.png public\images\odysseus-statue.png public\images\zeus-statue.png
git commit -m "chore: add statue image assets"
git push origin main
```

If you'd like, I can commit and push these files for you once you confirm they're in this folder or upload them here and I will move them into the repo for you.
